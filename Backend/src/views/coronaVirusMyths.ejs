        <div class="content">
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 1: COVID-19 is just like the flu.</h2>
                <p>Fact: While both are respiratory illnesses, COVID-19 is more contagious, spreads faster, and has a higher mortality rate than the flu.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 2: You can kill the virus by drinking alcohol or using strong disinfectants inside your body.</h2>
                <p>Fact: Drinking alcohol or using disinfectants internally is dangerous and does not kill the virus inside your body.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 3: Only elderly people are at risk.</h2>
                <p>Fact: While older adults and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk, young people can also get infected, suffer severe illness, and spread the virus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 4: Hot weather can kill the virus.</h2>
                <p>Fact: COVID-19 spreads in all climates, including hot and humid regions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 5: Face masks protect 100% from infection.</h2>
                <p>Fact: While masks help reduce transmission, they do not provide complete protection. Social distancing and hand hygiene are also necessary.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 6: Holding your breath for 10 seconds without coughing means you are not infected.</h2>
                <p>Fact: This is false. The only reliable way to confirm infection is through a COVID-19 test.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 7: Home remedies like garlic, ginger, or turmeric can cure COVID-19.</h2>
                <p>Fact: While these may boost immunity, they do not cure or prevent COVID-19.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 8: COVID-19 is caused by 5G networks.</h2>
                <p>Fact: COVID-19 is caused by a virus (SARS-CoV-2), not radio waves or mobile networks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 9: If you had COVID-19 once, you can’t get it again.</h2>
                <p>Fact: Reinfections are possible, though rare. Immunity varies from person to person.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 10: COVID-19 vaccines alter your DNA.</h2>
                <p>Fact: The vaccines do not change your DNA. They help your immune system recognize and fight the virus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 11: Antibiotics can treat COVID-19.</h2>
                <p>Fact: COVID-19 is a viral infection, and antibiotics only work against bacterial infections.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h2>Myth 12: The pandemic is over.</h2>
