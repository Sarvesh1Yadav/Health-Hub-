                <h3>What is Medicare?</h3>
                <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities or specific medical conditions. It is divided into different parts that cover hospital care, medical services, and prescription drugs.</p>

                <h3>What is Medicaid? </h3>
                <p>Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. Each state administers its own Medicaid program, leading to variations in eligibility and benefits. Medicaid covers a broad range of medical services, including hospital visits, doctor’s appointments, and long-term care.</p>

                <h3>Key Differences Between Medicare and Medicaid</h3>
                <p>While both programs help cover healthcare costs, they serve different populations and have distinct eligibility requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Medicare is primarily for seniors and certain disabled individuals, while Medicaid is based on income level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Medicare has multiple parts (A, B, C, and D) with different coverage options, whereas Medicaid covers a wide range of services, often at little to no cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Medicare beneficiaries typically pay premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, while Medicaid often has minimal costs for recipients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Medicare is managed by the federal government, whereas Medicaid is run by individual states with federal oversight.</li>
                </ul>                
            </div>

                <h3>Can Someone Have Both Medicare and Medicaid?</h3>
                <p>Yes, some individuals qualify for both programs, known as "dual eligibility." These beneficiaries receive additional benefits, such as help with Medicare premiums and co-pays, as well as expanded Medicaid services.</p>
